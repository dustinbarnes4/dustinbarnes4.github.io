Name: Dustin Barnes

Styling: 

*I used sans-serif family font for the webpage.
*In this web page I decided to use a CSS grid to position my elements. 
*I placed the elements inside of an overall grid container that is invisible so that the static background can be seen behind them.
*The background I chose is static and does not scroll with the rest of the page.
*I placed a saturn shaped favicon on the webpage to match the background.
*My div elements inside of the grid container are semi transparent so that the stary background can faintly be seen. 
*Inside of the div containers I put a gradient that starts white at the bottom, and fades to a light grey toward the headers.
*I made the headers block elements and gave them grey background color and rounded edges with border radius.
*I used box shadow on the bottom of the div headers to give them a 3d effect.
*I made it so that when the mouse hovers over each div it will transform and grow by 1.05.
*My haiku I made into a black element and centered and italicized the text inside of it.
*In the table I made each collumn and row identical sizes.
*I color coded the table so that each thing was a different color. 
*For the links in the page I made them only underline the text when they are hovered over with the mouse.
*I created a footer at the bottom of the page and used ampersand characters for the copyright symbol and emdash
